## About

This repo will contain the solutions for any of the LeetCode problems that I have solved. I am not aiming for top 1% of
all submissions with my solutions, but I am definitely going to try and get the best results that I can while still 
maintaining clean and readable code.

I will try my best to add comments such that my thought process is clearly explained, though, I cannot guarantee 
anything. Any links or percentiles that are included in the comments are subject to change, and I can only guarantee 
their accuracy for the exact moment that they were added in said comments.
